Q: I see that the OCS requires an exposure time... must I work  and how do I it out from the reported visual magnitude 

Q: Would you like the list to be parameterised... i.e user specifies max number of possible reference targets in one night?

Q: Need some serious help understanding the OCS requests...



  *** Include PLots 
  - Tracks 
  - Sky with confidence 



Exposure Time - Mag diff 


EXPOSURE TIME: High SNR without saturation.
